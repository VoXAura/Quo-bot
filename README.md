## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VoXAura/Quo-Bot.git
cd Quo-Bot
```

### 2. **Install Python Dependencies**
- Recommended Python version: **3.11**
- Install with pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Or with Poetry:
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install --no-dev
```

#### **Running on External Hosting Sites (e.g., Railway, Replit, Heroku, etc.)**
- If you face issues downloading requirements, install them in this order:
  1. `pip install -r basicrequire.txt`
  2. `pip install -r dbrequire.txt`
  3. `pip install -r minimalrequire.txt`
  4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- After all requirements are installed, you can change the config for requirements (if your host allows) to `rrs.txt` for faster or custom installs.

### 3. **Configure Environment (via `src/config.py`)**
- All configuration is done directly in `src/config.py`.
- Set your PostgreSQL, Discord token, webhook URLs, and other settings in this file.
- Example fields to set:
```
POSTGRESQL = { ... }
DISCORD_TOKEN = "..."
SHARD_LOG = "..."
ERROR_LOG = "..."
PUBLIC_LOG = "..."
SERVER_PORT = 1234
SOCKET_URL = "..."
SOCKET_AUTH = "..."
PREMIUM_ROLE = ...
SERVER_ID = ...
VOTER_ROLE = ...
OCR_SPACE_API_KEY = "..."
```

### 4. **Database Setup**
- The bot uses **PostgreSQL**. Make sure your database is running and accessible.
- Tortoise ORM will auto-generate schemas on first run.
- **Tip:** You can use [Railway](https://railway.app/) for easy PostgreSQL hosting.

### 5. **Run the Bot**
```bash
python src/bot.py
```

### 6. **(Optional) Run with Docker**
- Build and run with Docker:
```bash
docker build -t quo-bot .
docker run quo-bot
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues & Troubleshooting

- **Emoji errors:**
  - If you see errors related to emojis, you can configure or update emoji IDs and names in `src/utils/emote.py`.
  - Some emoji issues may be internal to Discord or the bot; contact support if unsure.
- **Database issues:**
  - Ensure your PostgreSQL configuration in `src/config.py` is correct.
  - You can use [Railway](https://railway.app/) for easy database hosting.
- **Scrims-related errors:**
  - Some advanced scrims functions may error due to Discord API or setup. If you encounter issues, [contact support](https://dsc.gg/quohq) for help.
- **Tournament CSV Generation:**
  - To configure tournament CSV file generation, you must change the server/channel ID in `src/cogs/esports/views/tourney/main.py` at **line 300**.
  - Make sure the channel ID you set exists in your server and the bot is present in that channel, or CSV export will fail.
